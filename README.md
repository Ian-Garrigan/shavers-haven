## Newsletter 

![Newsletter](documentation/screenshots/readme/newsletter.png)

##### The mailchimp embedded newsletter for the business marketing emails.
I've integrated Mailchimp into the website, enabling users to subscribe via an embedded form to learn more about Shavers Haven and encourage repeat business. An automated Welcome email campaign expresses our thanks to subscribers. Additionally, i've created a manual Newsletter campaign, where each subscriber receives valuable content. The goal is to foster a community, which i believe will result in returning customers, ultimately boosting the business.


## Mobile
The website is Mobile First, therefore, the change from mobile to desktop form is seamless and offers users use the same using experience. 

![mobile-device](documentation/screenshots/testing/mobile-device/pixel-mobile.png)



## UI-design 
![Colors](documentation/screenshots/readme/color-palette.png)

Opted for a minimalistic design, with colour scheme, fonts and squared  lines  that match the target audience ( described under section  “ideal user”) to convey strong brand identity. 

# Wireframes
To kickstart this project, I originally began by designing a layout using wireframes. For the front page, I opted for a Hero Image to offer users an immediate glimpse into the essence of the business. The product detail pages & all products view, on the other hand, feature individual cards that succinctly present all the essential details – enabling users to quickly assess the product, its price, and a brief description. Soon i added further to these design elements like the ability to create a product wishlist and leave a simple review underneath the detailed individual product pages. I have followed through with all of my original design processes and am happy with how the website turned out in the end. I feel like it offers everything a traditional shaver could want.

# Database Schema

The UserProfile and the Product Database serve as the primary components in the schema, connecting all products and profiles. The Products Database enables a connection to the Order Database, including the order number. It also allows for the creation of a Wishlist for users, utilizing a ManyToMany database structure to enable each user to add as many desired products as they wish.

The connection between the Review Database and the Profile Database allows a registered/authenticated user to leave reviews for a product and delete them after if they wish.

![erd](documentation/screenshots/readme/erd-diagram.png)

# Agile Methodology
I developed this project using agile methodologies, where I split each feature into User Stories, addressing the user's perspective and expectations on the website. I thoughtfully planned these User Stories, resulting in the creation of multiple tasks that I needed to implement specific features. I then grouped these tasks into Epics for efficient project management.

To facilitate and visualize this agile process, I used a Kanban board created within Github Projects, which you can explore [here](https://github.com/users/Ian-Garrigan/projects/6). Each User Story is meticulously detailed with a set of acceptance criteria, clearly defining the required functionality for its completion.

To prioritize my work, I used a labeling system, classifying features as 'Must Have,' 'Should Have,' 'Could Have,' and 'Won't Have.' I gave the highest priority to the 'Must Have' stories, tackling them first to ensure that the project's core requirements were addressed promptly to provide a solid foundation. In some cases, I implemented certain 'Should Have' features ahead of schedule due to their alignment with critical tasks, like some product-related 'Should Have's' being developed alongside 'Must Have' tasks such as error templates. The remaining features were incorporated based on available capacity and timing.

### Epics & User Stories

I generated a total of 16 Epics, which were subsequently broken down into 27 User Stories. You can explore comprehensive details about each Epic and its associated User Stories on the project's Kanban board linked above.

    #16 EPIC: Document development 

    #15 EPIC: Error template pages
