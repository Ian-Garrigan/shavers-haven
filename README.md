## Newsletter 

![Newsletter](documentation/screenshots/readme/newsletter.png)

##### The mailchimp embedded newsletter for the business marketing emails.
I've integrated Mailchimp into the website, enabling users to subscribe via an embedded form to learn more about Shavers Haven and encourage repeat business. An automated Welcome email campaign expresses our thanks to subscribers. Additionally, i've created a manual Newsletter campaign, where each subscriber receives valuable content. The goal is to foster a community, which i believe will result in returning customers, ultimately boosting the business.

## UI-design 
![Colors](documentation/screenshots/readme/color-palette.png)

Opted for a minimalistic design, with colour scheme, fonts and squared  lines  that match the target audience ( described under section  “ideal user”) to convey strong brand identity. 

# Wireframes
To kickstart this project, I began by designing a layout using wireframes. For the front page, I opted for a Hero Image to offer users an immediate glimpse into the essence of the business. The product detail pages & all products view, on the other hand, feature individual cards that succinctly present all the essential details – enabling users to quickly assess the product, its price, and a brief description.

# Agile Methodology
I developed this project using agile methodologies, where I split each feature into User Stories, addressing the user's perspective and expectations on the website. I thoughtfully planned these User Stories, resulting in the creation of multiple tasks that I needed to implement specific features. I then grouped these tasks into Epics for efficient project management.

To facilitate and visualize this agile process, I used a Kanban board created within Github Projects, which you can explore [here](https://github.com/users/Ian-Garrigan/projects/6). Each User Story is meticulously detailed with a set of acceptance criteria, clearly defining the required functionality for its completion.

To prioritize my work, I used a labeling system, classifying features as 'Must Have,' 'Should Have,' 'Could Have,' and 'Won't Have.' I gave the highest priority to the 'Must Have' stories, tackling them first to ensure that the project's core requirements were addressed promptly to provide a solid foundation. In some cases, I implemented certain 'Should Have' features ahead of schedule due to their alignment with critical tasks, like some product-related 'Should Have's' being developed alongside 'Must Have' tasks such as error templates. The remaining features were incorporated based on available capacity and timing.
